[{"categories":null,"contents":"Welcome to my corner of the internet! I’m Unique Karki, and I’m here to share a little about my journey—bumpy roads, wild adventures, and all.\nWhere It All Began I was born and raised in Kathmandu as a single child, which meant my parents showered me with attention and a treasure trove of learning experiences. They enrolled me in everything from art and music classes to sports, ensuring I explored a little bit of everything. This diverse upbringing sparked my love for learning and left me with a range of skills I still cherish today—turns out, their plan worked like a charm!\nStrumming Through the Years My love for music kicked off when my grandfather brought home a harmonium, instantly sparking my curiosity to create my own tunes. I was especially drawn to the guitar, inspired by my musically inclined uncle (thanks, maternal side!). I had the privilege of learning from some of the best in Nepal, including Mr. Sunit Kansakar from Mukti and Revival, and Mr. John Shrestha from Sabin Rai \u0026amp; The Pharaoh. Over the years, I’ve performed in various competitions, from cozy gatherings to larger crowds. While I’m still honing my skills, I definitely don’t shy away from the spotlight—just a little exposure therapy!\nPages That Left a Mark My reading journey really took off at St. Xavier\u0026rsquo;s School, where they made reading books a big deal. I still remember the thrill of getting my first library card and heading straight for the shelves. The first book I picked up was Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u0026rsquo;s Stone, and I was instantly hooked! Over the years, I found myself gravitating towards philosophical works, with Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment becoming my all-time favorite. Reading isn’t just a hobby for me; it’s a part of who I am. So, if you ever ask me what I\u0026rsquo;m reading, I promise I’ll always have a title to share!\nStaying Active I started running after high school, and let me tell you, it’s a love/hate relationship! At the same time, I picked up swimming, and I absolutely love it—I can swim 1 km continuously and I’m working on leveling up my skills. During my undergrad years, I hit the gym and played basketball, even snagging a few competition wins along the way. Now, I’m all about trail running, and the community is incredibly supportive—it’s like a family! There’s something serene about tackling those challenging terrains alone, even if it means running for hours with just a bottle of water. I’ve completed the KVR-100, which is a wild 100-mile run around the stunning Kathmandu Valley. I also squeeze in some tennis every now and then. With running and swimming under my belt, I decided to take on a triathlon—without much cycling experience! It was a New Year’s resolution for 2024, and I jumped at the chance. Through all these activities, I’ve found joy in keeping fit and challenging myself.\nLittle Passions I’ve always had a curious mind, and I love picking up new hobbies! A while back, I started learning French, and I’ve picked up a few phrases that usually get a laugh from French speakers. I also took up crochet, and now I often find myself getting requests to make something—honestly, I don’t mind at all! Gardening is another passion; there’s something so calming about watering my plants in the evening—it’s my little moment of zen. I’m also a fan of diving into university lectures on a variety of topics; I just love soaking up new knowledge. While some might think my pursuits are a bit all over the place, I truly believe that no skill or bit of knowledge ever goes to waste. I’m all about embracing new experiences and keeping the learning spirit alive!\nLooking back at my journey, I’m thankful for every experience that has shaped who I am today. I can’t wait to see what new adventures and lessons lie ahead as I continue to embrace curiosity and growth!\n","date":"October 11, 2024","hero":"/posts/my-story/background.png","permalink":"https://uniquekarki.github.io/posts/my-story/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWelcome to my corner of the internet!
