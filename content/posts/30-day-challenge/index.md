After the successful completion of [30 day running challenge](https://www.tiktok.com/@karki_nick/video/7508944110640762128), I wanted something similar in the technical realm. The main goal of this challenge is consistency in my work. So I will be posting log for each day which may include the papers I read, the ideas I implemented; all things work.


The rules of this challenge:
1. 1 hour personal project block: Polish coding skills and work on personal projects.
2. 1 hour research block: Work on research project.

Starts - May 28, 2025</br>
Ends - June 26, 2025
